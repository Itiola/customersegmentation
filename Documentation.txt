Segmentation Based on Demographics: 

Location: If your business operates geographically, segmenting by location (country, region, city) allows for localized
marketing campaigns and product variations. 

Segmentation Based on Behavior: 

Purchase History: Analyze purchase frequency, average order value, and product categories purchased to segment high-value
customers, frequent buyers, or those who haven't purchased in a while (win-back campaigns).
